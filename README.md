# epicsDbChains
Static analysis of EPICS runtime DB scan chains.
Perl script to read EPICS runtime DB(s) and find all scan chqains for a list of specified hardware IO record types. The use case is to get a measure of the rate of IO cycles executed on a VME (or CAMAC...) backplane.

The list of records to scan is given a commandline arguments, and in the initial use case is scraped from the EPICS startup script, by finding all instsances of the dbLoadRecords() commands.

For now, the script does NOT try to (cannot) ascertain 
  * IO cycles executed due to Channel Acces writes, 
  * IO cycles generated by PP links to record fields, 
  * cycles generated through Events
